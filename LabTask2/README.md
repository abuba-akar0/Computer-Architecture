# 📖 Computer Architecture Lab 02 – Machine Instructions Simulation

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture Lab 02** repository!  
This lab is designed to help you grasp the core concepts of **Machine Instructions**, their structure, and how they execute inside a simple simulated CPU environment using **CPU Sim**.

---

## 📌 Lab Objectives

- Understand **Machine Instructions** and their role in program execution.
- Define an **Instruction Format** and identify key fields (Opcode, Operands).
- Execute a **Microinstruction Sequence** step-by-step.
- Perform addition of two numbers using basic machine instructions.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Required

- 💻 **Computer System**
- 🖥️ **CPU Sim**: A simple CPU simulator for visualizing and debugging instruction executions.

---

## 📑 Contents

- 📘 **Lab Manual 2.pdf** — Full step-by-step guide to perform the lab  
  (Includes instructions, opcodes, microinstruction sequences, and input/output operations)

---

## 🚀 Quick Lab Overview

1. **Write Instructions** using correct opcodes.
2. Set **microinstructions for input**, output, store, and add operations.
3. Simulate and **execute the instructions in CPU Sim**.
4. Provide number inputs and verify the result.
