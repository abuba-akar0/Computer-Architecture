## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts

### Flip-Flops
Basic building blocks of sequential circuits that store one bit of data:
- **SR Flip-Flop**: Set-Reset behavior.
- **D Flip-Flop**: Data storage on clock edge.
- **JK Flip-Flop**: Universal flip-flop with no invalid state.
- **T Flip-Flop**: Toggle or hold behavior based on input.

### Registers
Groups of flip-flops used to store multi-bit data:
- **4-bit Register** using D Flip-Flops.
- **Shift Registers**: Left/Right and Bidirectional.
- **Register File**: Collection of multiple registers for CPU register banks.

### Counters
Circuits that cycle through a sequence of states:
- **3-bit Binary Up Counter** using JK Flip-Flops.
- **4-bit Asynchronous (Ripple) Counter**
- **4-bit Synchronous Counter**
